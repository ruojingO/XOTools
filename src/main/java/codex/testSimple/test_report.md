# Test Report for `Test` Class

## Overview
The `Test` class consists of two versions: the original version that throws an exception due to division by zero and the refactored version that gracefully handles the error.

### File Locations
- **Original Version**: `TestOriginal.java`
- **Refactored Version**: `Test.java`

## Purpose
- To verify the functionality of both versions of the `Test` class, particularly focusing on how they handle division by zero.

## Methodology
1. **Compilation**: Both Java files were compiled to ensure there were no syntax errors.
2. **Execution**: A test script was created to run both versions sequentially.
3. **Output Capture**: The outputs and errors were captured to analyze the behavior of each version.

## Test Execution Results

### Outputs
- **Original Version (`TestOriginal`)**
  - Output: None
  - Error: Runtime Exception due to division by zero.

- **Refactored Version (`Test`)**
  - Output:
    ```
    Error: Division by zero is not allowed.
    Current date format: YYYY-MM-DD
    ```

### Summary of Results
- The original version threw an `ArithmeticException` as expected due to the division by zero.
- The refactored version handled the error gracefully, providing a user-friendly error message and formatted the current date.

## Conclusion
The refactor successfully improves the error handling of the original implementation. The `Test` class now prevents the application from crashing and provides meaningful feedback during the execution.

## Recommendations
For further improvement:
- Consider adding unit tests using a testing framework to automate this verification process in the future.
